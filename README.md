# mission-chief-disable-mouse-zoom
A simple script to disable mouse wheel zooming on the map in Missionchief.<br>
Please let me know if there are any issues.<br><br>
<strong>This Script collects no user data</strong><br><br>
<strong>How to install</strong><br>
<li>Firstly, install the [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension onto your browser</li>
<li>Secondly, copy the script and paste it into a new userscript</li>
<li>Finally, refresh your Missionchief page</li>
Voila - your mouse wheel no longer zooms the map.<br><br>
I hope this helps, and if anyone knows how I can make this autoinstall with JS please let me know :)
